meshmodify
========

This was a graphics assignment to implement a mesh smoothing and subdivision
algorithm. 

While working on the smoothing algorithm, I made a different algorithm by accident,
but I thought it looked cool so I kept it. I would put up the full source code, but the 
same assignment may still be in use in the graphics class that I took.

The program will load a mesh (some samples are provided, the .exe loads 
"spaceship.obj" by default), display it, and allow the following inputs:

space bar - cycle through polygons in the mesh
d - delete selected polygon
s - apply smoothing/subdivision algorithm
y - run the accidental mesh-modifying algorithm
r - reset the mesh
